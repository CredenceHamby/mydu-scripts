# Blueprint Batch importer

This document provides information on how to use the provided Bash script to post JSON files to a specified URL using a Docker container.

**Attention:**
- **All users**: this script will only work for linux , working on a working script for windows.

## Overview

The Bash script is designed to:
1. Post blueprint JSON files from a specified directory to a given URL.
2. Utilize Docker and Docker Compose to handle the posting process via `curl`.

## Prerequisites

- **Docker and Docker Compose**: Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed on your system.
- **Mydu Server Installation:** Ensure you have a Mydu server installed and running, as the script interacts with this server.

## How to Use

1. **Update the Script Variables**:
   - **DIRECTORY**: Adjust the path if you need to.
   - the standard path is a subfolder of the folder where the script is located called `blueprints`
   - for ease of use you can download the file place it in a folder of you're mydu installation folder , and crete a subfolder called `blueprints`. place all the blueprints that need to be uploaded. 

2. **Save the Script**: Save the Bash script to a file on your system.

3. **Make the Script Executable**:
   - Run the command: `chmod +x your_script_file.sh` (replace `your_script_file.sh` with the actual name of your script file).

4. **Run the Script**:
   - Execute the script with the command: `./your_script_file.sh`.

## Expected Output

- The script will print the status of each file being processed.
- Success and error messages will indicate if the posting was successful or if any issues occurred.

## Notes

- Ensure the specified directory contains JSON files. If no files are found, the script will terminate with an appropriate message.
- The script encodes JSON files in Base64 before posting. Ensure the receiving endpoint is compatible with this format.
